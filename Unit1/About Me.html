      <strong>About Me</strong>
    </nav>


		<p>My name is Buddy Moreno.  I'm typically a laid back person but with this website, I hope to conquer a new horizon by developing new skills and showcasing them in this new endeavor.

		I'm a technical writer by profession but I consider myself a dabbler born out of curiosity for everything I get myself exposed into.  I hope to feed my curiosity continuously, with the help of my wife, especially our enjoyment of travelling.
